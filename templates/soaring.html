            <p class="card-text">Soaring is probably the most exciting form of flight. Instead of avoiding the sometimes
              extreme
              vertical
              movements of the atmosphere, soaring is about understanding them and harnessing their power.
              Incredible,
              hard-to-imagine feats are possible in gliders and the nearby Eastern Sierras are world-renown for
              their soar
              ability.</p>

            <p class="card-text">There are 4 main forms of lift in soaring: ridge lift where air is forced up by a slope
              (common form
              for <a href="/paragliding">paragliders</a>), convergence where air masses meet
              (often terrain induced), thermals where blooms of air rise due to heat, and wave lift produced by
              downstream waves from disturbance by mountains (think of ripples downstream of rocks in a river). The
              Eastern Sierras are notorious for their mountain wave conditions. While transiting powered aircraft are
              often hit by intense turbulence, glider pilots seek out the upward moving air on the front edge of the
              wave
              to climb to spectacular airliner altitudes, all without an engine.
